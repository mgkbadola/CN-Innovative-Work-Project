# Guess the Longest Word!
A project aimed at making the experience of increasing the vocabulary a bit more fun, with a game-score concept for our users.

✯✯✯✯✯ Rules ✯✯✯✯✯
1. User has to select in total, 5 letters with the choice of either selecting a vowel or a consonant one at a time.
2. After all the 5 letters are chosen, the user has to enter the maximum longest word that they can think of, provided the given letters can be used as many times as possible.
3. After entering the word, user's score would be graded based on the length of the word entered OUT OF length of the maximum word.
4. The user can continue playing the game, with the retained score, or can close the window and start a new client session.

Achieved using socket programming and Pygame GUI.
